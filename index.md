**Welcome to my website!**

I am Francesco Montesano, a physicists and programmer living in Munich, Germany.

Since I was young, my preference for scientific topics was clear, but it was a
public talk that made me fall in love with physics. I ended up studying physics
in Milano and obtaining a doctorate degree in astronomy in Garching, Germany.

While thinking about far away galaxies, I discovered the joy of programming.
From a necessity software development became a passion and a profession.
Currently I am part of a small team responsible for developing a number of
products for scheduling of [HETDEX](http://hetdex.org/) observations and their
subsequent storage and analysis.

When I don't think about coding and [Python](https://www.python.org/) I occupy
my time with my family or some good book.
